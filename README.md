Machine Learning, Fall 2020
Professor: Charles Isbell & Michael Littman
Georgia Tech 

Assignments cover the major topics of the class:
- Supervised Learning (Assignments 1 & 2)
- Unsupervised Learning (Assignment 3)
- Reinforcement Learning (Assignment 4)

In each assignment, use the same datasets on a variety of algorithms and compare performance, using various accuracy/F1/Error rate metrics as a measure of success. Tune parameters and hyperparameters. Understand learning curve analysis and model complexity analysis in order to choose the optimal model for each problem.
